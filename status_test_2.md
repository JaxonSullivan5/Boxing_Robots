We have went through a couple of iterations of the score board, we first started with lcd display screens however they have been difficult to use, we then went with the idea of
using a 7 segment 1 digit counter to display the score because you are just sending power to led lights making the coding much simpler. The only problem is the amount of pins
that are available so we might have to power two different systems, one for the score board and head knock out and one for the arms and movement.

Which parts still need to be ordered/manufactured? 
Were still figuring out the head and need to manufacture the brackets that are going to hold the servos and movement actuators in place.

You will demonstrate at least two functional elements that work although do not need to be integrated into the larger system.
The X axis movement and the score board
