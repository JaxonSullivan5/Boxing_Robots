For the project, we have worked on the budgeting aspect as well as components and then we have brainstormed different ways that the parts will look like
We haven't ordered any parts yet because we are still finding out exactly what we will need
We haven't designed parts yet but we will have the first drafts done in 3 weeks at the latest
If weâ€™re able to hit the deadline, May 13th, we will hit all the required parts
Some of the design problems we foresee are making the robots fight fairly and balancing it so there is little to no cheating
